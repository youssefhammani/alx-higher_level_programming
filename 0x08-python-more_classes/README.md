# Project: 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Project Description
This project focuses on enhancing knowledge and skills in Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). It involves various tasks aiming to develop a deeper understanding of classes, objects, attributes, methods, and their implementations. The tasks progressively cover defining a Rectangle class, its attributes, methods to calculate area, perimeter, and more, ultimately culminating in solving the N queens puzzle.

## Project Details
- **Project Start:** October 30, 2023, 4:00 AM
- **Project End:** November 2, 2023, 4:00 AM
- **Evaluation Method:** Auto QA review

## Learning Objectives
The tasks aim to help participants grasp the following key concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class and Instance Attributes
- Methods and their use
- Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`
- Dynamic attribute creation in Python
- And more as detailed in the task descriptions

## Repository Structure
- **GitHub repository:** [alx-higher_level_programming](link_to_repository)
- **Directory:** 0x08-python-more_classes

## Tools & Requirements
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Execution Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5
- **Linting Tool:** Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **File Length Check:** Evaluated using `wc`
- **Additional Requirements:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - All files must be executable.

## Tasks Overview
The project comprises several tasks focusing on building a Rectangle class with various features and functionalities. Each task enhances specific aspects of OOP and Python programming.

### Task List
1. **Simple Rectangle**
    - Empty class Rectangle definition.

2. **Real Definition of a Rectangle**
    - Private attributes: width and height, with getters and setters.
    - Instantiation with optional width and height.

3. **Area and Perimeter**
    - Implements area and perimeter calculation methods.

4. **String Representation**
    - Enhances the class to display rectangle string representation.
    - Covers `__str__` and `__repr__`.

5. **Eval is Magic**
    - Adds features for evaluation using `eval()`.

6. **Detect Instance Deletion**
    - Detects instance deletion and handles messages accordingly.

7. **How Many Instances**
    - Tracks the number of class instances created.

8. **Compare Rectangles**
    - Compares rectangles based on area.

9. **A Square is a Rectangle**
    - Implements a square class method.

10. **N Queens**
    - Solves the N Queens puzzle.

## Usage


## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Python's OOP concepts through practical implementation. By completing these tasks, participants will gain expertise in creating and working with classes, objects, and their associated attributes and methods in Python.
